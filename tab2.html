			<h4 style = "color: black">Why choose solar?</h4>
			<p>
				The cost of electricity (~$0.12/kWh) will continue to rise, but the sun will continue to rise as well. A solar investment capitalizes on this by allowing you to offset your power utility costs using with solar power. The value of the electricity generated by the solar module continues to rise every year, over a period of time you save much more money on electrical energy cost than you spent on the investment. BTW itâ€™s completely green!

			</p>

			<h4 style = "color: black">What is a solar module?</h4>
			<p>
				The Sun emits a bountiful amount of power (1000s of kWhs/ m2-year) onto the earth in the form of light. A solar module is a device that collects the light and turns it into usable electric power. The light to electricity conversion is done in the photovoltaic cell is made of ultra pure silicon sandwiched between two metal wire contacts. The solar collector is usually just glass, however reflectors can be used to reflect the sunlight towards to glass such as the IBN Sunflower. 
			</p>

			<h4 style = "color: black">Where can you use them?</h4>
			<p>
				Due to modern technology they can be made durable and lightweight which has made it possible to use them virtually anywhere. However, large-scale residential applications have not seen much success, with the exception of rooftop systems, which are limited by light shading issues and high installation costs. IBN takes a different approach by utilizing a large steel pole in an aesthetically pleasing design; you can put them anywhere in your yard (even tiny ones).
			</p>

			<h4 style = "color: black">How is the price of a Solar Power System determined?</h4>
			<p>
				The price of a system is determined by its size and location. However, the price is rated by $/W (power output is location dependent) and location cost variability is fairly ambiguous with many different variables. IBN will simplify it for you check it out:
				<ul>
					<li>Solar Module: SM = $80 - $120 per square meter</li>
					<li>Balance of System: (Power Electronics including battery): BOS =  $250-$1000 (depends on added features)</li>
					<li>Steel Pole: $15-20/foot (typically want to be at least 8ft tall and 3ft deep in the ground)</li>
					<li>Installation Cost: $200-500 (contractor dependent)
					Overhead Cost (Storage, Transportation, labor): $60 per square meter</li>
					<li>State and Federal Tax Incentives: ~25-30% will vary depending on your state representative (IBN encourages you to vote for Solar).</li> 
				</ul>

				All of these costs are added up to give you the IBN solar system price. Notice that in some states the consumer can get a sizable tax money return for investing in solar. No smoking mirrors or overly inflated prices; our purpose to maximize your dollar and spread knowledge. 
			</p>

			<h4 style = "color: black">How much money should you expect to make from buying solar?</h4>
			<p>
				The exact amount of money a solar investment will return can be calculated with a reasonable accuracy, however it varies from person to person. On average one can expect to save over $50 per square meter (2015, national average), this will increase annually by 3-5% per year (depending on the economy). Notice that the bigger the solar panel size you buy the higher your return on investment. Since the IBN Sunflower design limits the maximum panel size to 10m2, multiple unit orders are encouraged and custom solutions are available upon request.
