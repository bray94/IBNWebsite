					What is Renewable energy
					<ul>
						<li>Renewable energy is power from sources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, waves, and geothermal heat. There has been a large push worldwide interest recently in transitioning from conventional fossil fuel based energy resources such as coal and natural gas to renewable resources which can be cheaper and better for the environment. Thirty nations already use renewable sources for more than 20% of their energy supply. For more information visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy" class="info-links">Wikipedia</a>.</li>
						<li>Keywords: Solar, Wind Turbine, biomass, geothermal, fossil fuel</li>
					</ul>
					How Do Solar Panels Work?
					<ul>
						<li>Solar cells are made of a semiconducting material such as silicon, and solar panels are made of many solar cells connected together. When light hits these cells it energizes the atoms, freeing their electrons.These electrons then flow across the cell creating a current which we harness as electrical power. Only about 15%-20% of the electricity is useful, while the rest is lost as heat. For more information visit <a href="http://www.livescience.com/41995-how-do-solar-panels-work.html" class="info-links">Livescience</a>.</li>
						<li>Keyword: Semiconductor, photovoltaic, electrons</li>
					</ul>
					Lifetime
					<ul>
						<li>Even though manufactures put a lot of work into making as robust solar panels as possible they still degrade overtime due to weather, heat, and UV radiation. For most common panels this degradation results in a 0.5% decrease in power output per year. In general most panels will operate for around 40 years but the real lifetime is variable; the world's first modern solar panel is still working after 60 years! Many solar providers will provide a 25-year warranty that guarantees the panel's performance will not drop below 80% during that time. For more information visit <a href="http://energyinformative.org/lifespan-solar-panels/" class="info-links">Energy Informative</a>.</li>

					</ul> 
					Solar Systems
					<ul>
						<li>Did you know that your electrical socket can send power in the other direction?</li>
						<li>Solar installations usually consist of three parts: the panel, a balance of systems (BOS), and an energy sink. The energy sink is usually your home, a battery, or the gridhome. The panel is the source of the energy, and the BOS covers all connections/conversion between the panel and the grid/homesink. This includes wiring, AC/DC converters, fuses, etc. The utility company installs a special meter for the solar system to track how much energy is produced similar to the way it tracks your energy usage. For more information on the solar system visit <a href="http://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2013/04/what-components-are-in-a-solar-energy-system/" class="info-links">this link</a> , and for more information on the  BOS visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_system" class="info-links">this link</a>.</li>

					</ul>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div id="market-textbox">
					<br>
					Tax Credits
					<ul>
						<li>Tax incentives are one of the government's strongest policy mechanisms to support the use of solar. One of the largest solar tax breaks is the federal government's solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) which will refund 30% of the solar installation cost through tax credits. In late 2015 the ITC was extended until 2019, where it will begin decreasing yearly until it ends in 2023. Along with this federal incentive many states also have their own tax incentives ,many of which come in the form of cash rebates. Find more information about your state incentives at http://www.dsireusa.org/.  More information about the ITC is included <a href="http://solaroutreach.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ResidentialITC_Factsheet_Final.pdf" class="info-links">here</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					SRECs
					<ul>
						<li>Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) are tradable energy commodities that represent 1 MWh of energy produced from a state certified solar installation. SRECs are used to track the sources of energy and can be sold by the solar panel owner to the utility companies for profit. Government regulations require these companies to adhere to a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) which requires a certain fraction of their energy to be produced using renewable sources. If the energy provider fails to meet their RPS they must pay a Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP). In order to avoid the SACP fees, utility companies are willing to buy SRECs on the open market where SREC value varies depending on supply and demand, although it never rises above the value of the SACP. For more information on SRECs visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Renewable_Energy_Certificate" class="info-links">this link</a>.  A list of states with active SREC programs, trade prices, and SACP process can be found at <a href ="http://www.srectrade.com/srec_markets/introduction" class="info-links">this link</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					Cost of Electricity
					<ul>
						<li>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) found that the average U.S. residential monthly electricity bill increased 3% per year, up to 6% in some states. This means that in 20 years the average U.S. electricity bill will rise to $180 month; $599 and $317 per month in the two most expensive states, Hawaii and Maryland respectively. Investing in solar is an investment in the future since the value of the produced energy will increase with time at the same rate of the cost of electricity.</li>

					Growth of Solar
					<ul>
						<li>The general trend seen in the solar industry since the early 2000's has been an increase in installation size with decreasing price.</li>
					</ul>
					Financing Options
					<ul>
						<li>When looking to install solar there are three major financing options: lease, loan, or purchase. If you choose to purchase the panels outright the capital cost is high but you will be able to receive all local, state, and federal incentives along with the entire revenue from the panel. A way around this is purchasing the panel using a loan. This way you own the panel but make monthly payments on the loan used to purchase the system. When you lease the panel a solar leasing company owns the system and becomes your primary energy provider, usually locking you into a lower energy cost capable though the energy from the PV panel. In the IBN Profit Sharing program we lease your space, giving you a fraction of the purchasing incentives as a signing bonus and providing you a portion of the PV array's profit in a yearly energy refund check.</li>
					</ul>
					Expected Return on Investment
					<ul>
						<li>In 25% of states you can expect a better 25 year return on investment from solar than from the S&P 500.</li>

					Where is the greatest loss of energy in the house?
					<ul>
						<li>The average American home spends $1,900 a year on energy; heating and cooling make up over 50% of this cost. Because of this, in most homes heat loss is the greatest source of energy and therefore money loss.  Most of this heat loss is due to leakiness and bad insulation. See <a href="http://greenhomegnome.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/energy-loss-insulation-infographic.jpg" class="info-links">this infographic</a> for more information.</li>
					</ul>
					Home energy upgrades and different types
					<ul>
						<li>Lighting</li>
						<ul>
							<li>In general LEDs use the lest energy but they have a high upfront cost, Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) are a good middle ground, and incandescent bulbs are the least efficient due to a lot of energy loss as heat resulting in their use being phased out. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaEvcZn2Xuw" class="info-links">this video</a> for more explanation of each lighting type.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>HVAC</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVAC" class="info-links">HVAC</a>) are usually the greatest energy consumer in a home. These systems control the temperature and circulation of air in a home which keeps the interior air comfortable and fresh. A good alternative to a conventional HVAC system is a heat pump, which uses a reverse Carnot engine to heat and cool the home with over 100% efficiency! For an explanation of how heat pumps work, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH47xAXEEe0" class="info-links">this video</a>.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Windows/Doors</li>
						<ul>
							<li> Windows and doors are some of the largest sources of heal loss in a home, both have high leakiness and low insulation value. To fix this different types of glazed and insulated windows have been made. The U.S. Department of Energy describes the different window types <a href="http://energy.gov/energysaver/window-types" class="info-links">here</a> and has purchasing suggestions <a href="http://energy.gov/energysaver/energy-efficient-windows" class="info-links">here</a>.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Insulation</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Insulation uses low density materials like fiberglass or wool as a barrier to limit heat loss from your house. The quality of the insulation, that is its ability to limit heat loss, is measured using the R-value; the higher the R-value the better the insulation. See <a href="http://www.level.org.nz/passive-design/insulation/how-insulation-works/" class="info-links">Level's website</a> for more information on insulation.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Energy Star Appliances</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Energy Star is an industry standard for rating the energy and cost effectiveness of appliances. Energy Star qualified appliances can use 10% to 50% less energy than standard appliances. For a list of the Energy Star standards and appliances visit the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products" class="info-links">Energy Star website</a>.</li>

					What is an energy audit?
					<ul>
