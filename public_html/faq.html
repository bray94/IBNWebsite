					What is Renewable energy
					<ul>
						<li>Renewable energy is power from sources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, wavestides, and geothermal heat.  There ishas been a large push worldwide interest recently to  in transitioning from conventional fossil fuel based energy resources such as coal and natural gas move from conventional fossil fuels to renewable resources which can be cheaper and better for the environment, with 30 nations already using renewable sources for more than 20% of their energy supply.  For more information visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy" class="info-links">Wikipedia</a>.</li>
						<li>Keywords: Solar, Wind Turbine, biomass, geothermal, fossil fuel</li>
					</ul>
					How do solar panels work?
					<ul>
						<li>Solar cells are made of a semiconducting material such as silicon, and solar panels are made of many solar cells connected together.  When light hits these cells it energizes the atoms, freeing their electrons. These electrons then flow across the cell creating a current which we harness as electrical power.  Only about 15%-20% of the electricity is useful, while the rest is lost as heat. For more information visit <a href="http://www.livescience.com/41995-how-do-solar-panels-work.html" class="info-links">Livescience</a>.</li>
						<li>Keyword: Semiconductor, photovoltaic, electrons</li>
					</ul>
					Lifetime
					<ul>
						<li>Even though manufactures put a lot of work into making as robust solar panels as possible they still, these panels will degrade overtime due to weather, heat, and UV radiation.  For most common panels this degradation results in a 0.5% decrease in power output per year.  In general most panels will operate for around 40 years but the real lifetime is variable; the world’s first modern solar panel is still working after 60 years!  Many solar providers will provide a 25-year warranty that guarantees the panel’s performance will not drop below 80% during that time.

					</ul> 
					Solar systems (panel, BOS, grid, local storage)
					<ul>
						<li>Did you know that your electrical socket can send power in the other way?</li>
						<li>Solar installations usually consist of three parts: the panel, a balance of systems (BOS), the power grid, and an energy sink.  The energy sink is usually your home, a battery, or the gridhome.  The panel is the source of the energy, and the BOS covers all connectionsconversion between the panel and the grid/homesink.  This includes wiring, AC/DC converters, fuses, etc. The utility company installs a special meter for the solar system to track how much energy is produced similar to the way it tracks your energy usage.  For more information on the solar system visit <a href="http://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2013/04/what-components-are-in-a-solar-energy-system/" class="info-links">this link</a> , and for more information on the  BOS visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_system" class="info-links">this link</a>.</li>

					Tax Credits
					<ul>
						<li>Tax incentives are one of the government’s strongest policy mechanisms to support the use of solar.  One of the largest solar tax breaks is the Federal government’s Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) which will refund 30% of the solar installation cost through tax rebatecredits.  In late 2015 the ITC was extended until 2019, where it will begin decreasing yearly until it ends in 2023.  Along with this federal incentive many states also have their own tax incentives many of which come in the form of cash rebatestax, find more information about your state incentives at http://www.dsireusa.org/.  More information about the ITC is included <a href="http://solaroutreach.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ResidentialITC_Factsheet_Final.pdf" class="info-links">here</a></li>
					</ul>
					SRECs
					<ul>
						<li>Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) are tradable energy commodities that represent 1 MWh of energy produced from a state certified solar installation.  SRECs are used to track the sources of energy and  and can be sold by the Solar panel owner to the utility companies for profit.  Government regulations require these companies to adhere to a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) which requires a certain fraction of their energy to be produced using renewable sources.  If the energy provider fails to meet their RPS they must pay a Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP).  In order to avoid the SACP fees, utility companies are willing to buy SRECs on the open market where SREC value varies depending on supply and demand, although it never rises above the value of the SACP.  For more information on SRECs visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Renewable_Energy_Certificate" class="info-links">this link</a>.  A list of states with active SREC programs, trade prices, and SACP process can be found at <a href ="http://www.srectrade.com/srec_markets/introduction" class="info-links">this link</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					Cost of electricity
					<ul>
						<li>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) found that the average U.S. residential monthly electricity bill increased 3% per year, up to 6% in some states.  This means that in 20 years the average U.S. electricity bill will rise to $180 month; $599 and $317 per month in the two most expensive states, Hawaii and Maryland respectively.  Investing in solar is an investment in the future since the value of the produced energy will increase with time at the same rate of the cost of electricity.</li>
