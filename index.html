						<p>
							Joining our shared profits program allows you to get paid for going solar. How? By joining the shared profits program you can take advantage of tax incentives, energy refund checks, consumer convenience, and no risk. You allow us to make solar available to you, and in return you make a little extra cash. All of this with no upfront cost to you.
						</p>

						<!-- Energy refund. Tax breaks. No out of pocket cost. Consumer convenience. 
						Joining our shared profits program allows you to take the next step in eliminating our reliance on fossil fuels. We install solar panels on your roof and cut you a percentage of the money we recieve from selling the energy back to the electric company. All of this with no upfront cost to you. You allow us to make solar available to everyone, and in return you earn a little extra cash. All you have to give us is your promise to do your part in protecting our planet. -->

						<div id="header">Your house isn't perfect.</div>
						<p> 
							Owning and maintaining a house requires a ton of work, and sometimes when it comes to our energy bills it seems like a ton of money. It's hard to tell what is worth spending money on now to save money on your energy bill later. That's where we come in. Energy audits usually require someone coming to your home and spending hours taking measurements and determining where your energy is being wasted. IBN uses innovation to save you both time and money. Let's bring energy audits in to the 21st century.
